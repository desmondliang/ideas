# I’m Not Burned Out. I’m In Between Identities.

For a long time, I thought I was just tired.

Tired of popups.  
Tired of inventory.  
Tired of supplier messages.  
Tired of running everything remotely from Tokyo while the heart of the business is still in Okinawa.

But recently I realized something more uncomfortable:

I’m not burned out.

I’m in between identities.

During the day, I operate like a manager.  
At night, I think like a brand builder.

And those two versions of me are fighting.

## The Operator Version of Me

The operator wakes up and thinks:

- Did inventory run low?
- Did that supplier respond?
- How did the popup numbers look?
- Are the online shops updated?
- Did staff handle that issue correctly?

The operator keeps things alive.  
The operator protects revenue.  
The operator makes sure the machine runs.

The problem?

I’ve outgrown him.

## The Visionary Version of Me

The other version of me doesn’t care about reorder thresholds.

He thinks about:

- What does Oki Social *mean*?
- What is our design language evolving into?
- How do we document military life in Japan in a way no one else is doing?
- How do I become a brand builder, not just a booth operator?

That version wants to create.  
To travel.  
To observe.  
To turn culture into art.

That version feels alive.

But every time he gains momentum, the operator version drags him back to logistics.

## The Real Tension

It’s not about being overwhelmed.

It’s about living in transition.

I built Oki Social with my hands.  
I poured concrete.  
I lifted the boxes.  
I negotiated in broken Japanese.  
I sold face-to-face.

That was necessary.

But now the business needs an architect, not a contractor.

And I’m still walking around with a hammer.

## Letting Go Isn’t the Same as Giving Up

For the last two years, I’ve tried to let my team drive more.

I run the business remotely from Tokyo.  
They handle daily operations in Okinawa.

But I still carry too much of it mentally.

I still step in too often.  
I still feel responsible for everything.  
I still check things I shouldn’t need to check.

Not because I don’t trust them.

Because I built it.

Letting go feels like losing part of myself.

But here’s the uncomfortable truth:

If the business collapses when I disappear for 30 days,  
then I didn’t build a brand.

I built a dependency.

And that’s not freedom.

---

## The Shift I Need to Make

If I want to become a brand builder, I need to redefine my role.

I am no longer:

- Inventory manager  
- Popup scheduler  
- Supplier follow-up guy  
- Daily decision processor  

I am:

- Creative Director  
- Brand voice  
- Strategic architect  
- Cultural storyteller  

If a task doesn’t move the brand forward,  
it shouldn’t live in my head.

That’s the new rule.

---

## What Freedom Actually Means to Me

Freedom isn’t “retiring.”

Freedom is:

- Traveling around Japan to get inspired  
- Designing because I want to, not because we need to hit numbers  
- Spending time with my kids without thinking about stock levels  
- Being the artist of the business, not the operator of the machine  

To get there, I need systems.  
I need scoreboards.  
I need clearer boundaries.

But more than that, I need to let go of the identity that got me here.

The operator built this.

The brand builder will scale it.

And right now, I’m in between.

That space is uncomfortable.

But it’s also growth.

And maybe this tension isn’t a problem.

Maybe it’s proof that I’m evolving.
